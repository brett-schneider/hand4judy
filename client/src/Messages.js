        <p>this is where your message centre will be. it's not been started on yet. somehow this div (as well as some others) appears pretty 
        much in between the logo and the menu. that's not supposed to be there. somehow the whole positioning and all and the div and whatnot
        have changed. i remember doing it all with fucking frames and tables. this div stuff seems quite good, except it works different to what
        i'm used to which kinda makes me pretty useless. ffs. somebody needs to teach me css. again.</p>
